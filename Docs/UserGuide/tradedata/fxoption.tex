\subsubsection{FX Option}

The \lstinline!FXOptionData!  node is the trade data container for the \emph{FxOption} trade type.   FX options with exercise styles  \emph{European} or \emph{American} are supported. 
The strike rate of an FX option is:
SoldAmount / BoughtAmount. The \lstinline!FXOptionData!  node includes one and only one \lstinline!OptionData! trade
component sub-node plus elements specific to the FX Option. The structure of an example \lstinline!FXOptionData! node
for a FX Option is shown in Listing \ref{lst:fxoption_data}.

\begin{listing}[H]

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{xml}
        <FxOptionData>
            <OptionData>
             ...
            </OptionData>
            <BoughtCurrency>EUR</BoughtCurrency>
            <BoughtAmount>1000000</BoughtAmount>
            <SoldCurrency>USD</SoldCurrency>
            <SoldAmount>1350000</SoldAmount>
        </FxOptionData>
\end{minted}

The meanings and allowable values of the elements in the \lstinline!FXOptionData!  node follow below.

\begin{itemize}
\item OptionData: This is a trade component sub-node outlined in section \ref{ss:option_data}. Note that the
  FX option type allows for \emph{European} and \emph{American} option styles only. For option type \emph{Put}, Bought and Sold currencies/amounts are switched compared to the trade data node.
For example, holder of BoughtCurrency EUR SoldCurrency JPY FX Call Option has the right to buy EUR using JPY, while
holder of the Put counterpart has the right to buy JPY using EUR, or equivalently sell EUR for JPY. An alternative to define the latter option is copy the Call option with following changes:
a) swapping BoughtCurrency with SoldCurrency, b) swapping BoughtAmount with SoldAmount and c) inverting the barrier level (for example changing 110 to 0.0090909). Here barrier level is
quoted as amount of EUR per unit JPY, which is not commonly seen on market and inconsistent with the format in Call options. For these reasons, using Put/Call flag instead is recommended.

\item BoughtCurrency: The bought currency of the FX option. See OptionData above for more details.

Allowable values:  See Currency in Table \ref{tab:allow_stand_data}.

\item BoughtAmount: The amount in the BoughtCurrency.  

Allowable values:  Any positive real number.

\item SoldCurrency: The sold currency of the FX option. See OptionData above for more details.

Allowable values:  See Currency in Table \ref{tab:allow_stand_data}.

\item SoldAmount: The amount in the SoldCurrency.  

Allowable values:  Any positive real number.

\end{itemize}

Note that FX Options also cover Precious Metals Options, i.e. with
currencies XAU, XAG, XPT, XPD.
