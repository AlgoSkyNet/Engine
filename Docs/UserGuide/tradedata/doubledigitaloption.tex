\subsubsection{Double Digital Option}

The \verb+DoubleDigitalOptionData+ node is the trade data container for the DoubleDigitalOption trade type, listing
\ref{lst:doubledigitaloption_data} shows the structure of an example with two underlying FX rates. Equity, Commodity and IR underlyings are also supported in arbitrary combinations. 
A double digital option is a binary option that pays out a fixed amount if the two underlyings (FX spots, Equity or Commodity prices, interest rates) are simultaneously in the money w.r.t. given strikes and option types at the option expiry.
