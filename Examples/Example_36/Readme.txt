The example has a EUR and GBP market with inflation.

Both EUR inflation and GBP inflation follows a Jarrow Yildrim (JY) model:
- the inflation index volatility is piecewise and calibrated to year on year inflation floors.
- the real rate volatility is constant and not calibrated.
- the real rate reversion is constant and not calibrated.
